# Hey
Young computer scientist, engineer & enthusiast.

## Development Interests
I, originally, began coding to mod videogames and solve tedious tasks.
However, this has evolved into a much more important aspect of my life.

**Goals**
- To simplify the lives of other developers through powerful libraries which are easy to comprehend
- To facilitate physical and repetitive labour through the use of robotics
- To make the field of robotics a safer environent for both users and creators
- To help cleanse the environment with robotics and other technologies
- To teach and learn others

## Projects
I firmly believe that project development is key in gaining experience in fields pertaining to software.
As such, I actively seek opportunities to develop projects.

- Participated in FIRST Robotics Competition for 3 years
- Participated in FIRST Tech Chalenge for 1 year
- Participated in the ICPC national finals 2024 (MX)
- Actively mentoring FRC teams
- Actively mentoring FTC teams
- Actively training to stay on the ICPC & other competitive programming platforms
- Began my first bachelor's in Robotics Engineering in 2024

## Tech Stack & Tooling
I am yet to add more to this section, but here is some information nonetheless

**Languages**
- Java since 2019. Active.
- C++ since 2020. Active.
- C since 2022. Active.
- Python since 2022.
- Willing to try: Rust, Haskell
- Tried, didn't like: JavaScript, TypeScript (6 months total)

**Build Tools**
- CMake since 2023
- GNU Make since 2020

**OSes**
- Linux since 2020. Active.
- Windows, as a dev, since 2019.

## Seeking
To seek continuous education is important in an ever growing environment.

- Earn a bachelor's in Robotics Engineering
- Earn a masters in Mathematics
- Earn a masters in Cybersecurity & Cryptography
- Earn a doctorate in Control Theory

## Iffy topics
Currently, there is one topic that I do not believe is something I will take part in soon.
I will **not** be participating in robotics projects mixed with generative AI.
As an advocate of maximal safety, I would first like to ensure that I can create several (and I mean SEVERAL) fully-fledged robots based on predictable and well-known patterns before having any form of artifical intelligence take over.
Furthermore, experience with Gen-AI is something I lack, so it would not be safe for me to apply it on an entity capable of modifying the physical landscape; at least not for now.
This is to ensure that, even if an AI-Powered robot decides, on its own, to harm any living creature, it becomes an impossible task for it.
